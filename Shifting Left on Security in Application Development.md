# Shifting Left on Security in Application Development

## Introduction
Shifting left on security refers to the practice of incorporating security considerations earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This approach allows organizations to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before they become ingrained in the application. By integrating security into the development process, teams can enhance the overall security posture and reduce the costs associated with late-stage fixes.

## The Importance of Shifting Left
Traditionally, security was an afterthought, often handled at the end of the development process during testing or even production deployment. This delay can lead to significant vulnerabilities being deployed in production environments. Shifting left enables:
- **Early Vulnerability Detection**: Finding issues at the coding stage reduces remediation costs.
- **Faster Feedback Loops**: Developers receive immediate feedback about security issues, promoting a culture of security care.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Development, security, and operations teams work together early in the SDLC.

## Strategies for Shifting Left
Here are several strategies to effectively shift left on security in application development:

### 1. Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Introduce tools that analyze source code for vulnerabilities during the development phase. For example, integrating SAST tools into your CI/CD pipeline ensures code is reviewed for security flaws every time developers make changes:

```yaml
# Sample CI/CD configuration using GitHub Actions
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run SAST Tools
        run: |
          # Imagine running a SAST tool here
          bandit -r .
```

### 2. Implement Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
While SAST analyzes code statically, DAST focuses on running instances of applications. Automating DAST tests as part of the deployment process can help identify runtime vulnerabilities. An example of a DAST tool integration is:

```bash
# Example of running a DAST tool like OWASP ZAP from the command line
zap.sh -cmd -quickurl http://yourapp.com -quickout report.html
```

### 3. Conduct Threat Modeling Early
Encourage teams to perform threat modeling during the design phase. This involves identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and implementing mitigations. Simplified threat modeling techniques include:

- **Identify Assets**: Determine what needs protection (e.g., user data, backend services).
- **Identify Threat Actors**: Understand who can potentially attack (malicious insiders, external attackers).
- **Identify Attack Vectors**: Analyze how threats can affect assets (network attacks, social engineering).

### 4. Secure Coding Practices
Provide training on secure coding practices to developers. Itâ€™s essential for software engineers to understand common flaws such as SQL Injection, XSS, and insecure deserialization. For example:

```python
# Python example preventing SQL Injection with parameterized queries
import sqlite3

def get_user_data(user_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchone()
```

### 5. Continuous Learning and Improvement
Establish a feedback loop that allows developers to learn from vulnerabilities discovered in production. Foster a culture of continuous improvement where security learnings are shared among team members.

## Conclusion
Shifting left on security is a proactive strategy that embeds security into the daily workflow of application development. By adopting practices such as SAST, DAST, threat modeling, and secure coding guidelines, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture and reduce costs related to late-stage vulnerability remediation. Security should evolve from being a roadblock to development to becoming an enabler for building robust and secure applications from the outset.
